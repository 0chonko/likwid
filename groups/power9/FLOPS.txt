METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
CPI  PMC5/PMC4
MFlops/s (SP/DP scalar assumed) 1.0E-06*PMC3*2.0/time
MFlops/s (SP vector assumed) 1.0E-06*PMC3*8.0/time

LONG
Formula:
CPI = PM_RUN_CYC/PM_RUN_INST_CMPL
MFlops/s (SP/DP scalar assumed) = 1.0E-06*PM_FLOP_CMPL*2.0/runtime
MFlops/s (SP vector assumed) = 1.0E-06*PM_FLOP_CMPL*8.0/runtime
MFlops/s (DP vector assumed) = 1.0E-06*PM_FLOP_CMPL*4.0/runtime
-
This group counts floating-point operations. All is derived out of a
single event PM_FLOP_CMPL, so if you have mixed usage of SP or DP and
scalar and vector operations, the count won't be exact. With pure codes
the counts are pretty accurate (e.g. when using likwid-bench).
