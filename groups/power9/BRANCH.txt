METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time

Branch rate   (PMC4)/PMC2
Branch misprediction rate  PMC3/PMC2
Branch misprediction ratio  PMC2/(PMC4)
Instructions per branch  PMC2/(PMC4)

Formulas:
Branch rate = BR_INST_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES/INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
Branch misprediction rate =  BR_MISP_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES/INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
Branch misprediction ratio = BR_MISP_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES/BR_INST_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES
Instructions per branch = INSTR_RETIRED_ANY/BR_INST_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES
-
The rates state how often in average a branch or a mispredicted branch occured
per instruction retired in total. The Branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
Instructions per branch is 1/Branch rate.
